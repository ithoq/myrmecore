MyrmeCore is a web based, centralized, wireless sensor network management tool that provides data storage, 
control, status & analysis for use in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployments.

Our goal is to make a flexible, scalable, easy to use and high quality platform that:

- Automatically stores measurement data into a database
- Allows command & control over WSN nodes by issuing predefined orders
- Perform relevant analysis over data samples by user demand, using data mining algorithms and techniques
- Reports WSN status, health, layout and alerts
