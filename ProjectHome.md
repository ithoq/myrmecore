# ¿What is it? #

MyrmeCore is a web based, centralized, wireless sensor network management tool that provides data storage, control, status & analysis for use in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployments.

Our goal is to make a flexible, scalable, easy to use and high quality platform that:

  1. Automatically stores measurement data into a database
  1. Allows command & control over WSN nodes by issuing predefined orders
  1. Perform relevant analysis over data samples by user demand, using data mining algorithms and techniques
  1. Reports WSN status, health, layout and alerts

# ¿How does it works? #

MyrmeCore is a web application. It means that it runs on a webserver and requires a web browser to use. Sensor measurements are wirelessly transmitted through the network to a gateway node, which inserts them into a database.

Subsequently, users perform queries and analysis using software tools from the graphical user interface. Users can also give orders to the WSN and check its status.
